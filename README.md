### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Laura Puccinelli

### I'm a Full Stack Developer
### About me ðŸ˜„ :
I'm convinced that the programming path is a continuous learning. I like to work with new technologies and face different challenges. In February 2021 I finished the SoyHenry bootcamp, in which learned many technologies and also carried out two projects, a web e-commerce and an educational application. I like to work in teams and I believe that this is fundamental to develop interesting and challenging projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to work
